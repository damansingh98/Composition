# Composition

#Implemented an example of one of the OOP concepts: Compostion (HAS-A relationship)

An easy way to show and describe multiple features of a particular object can be achieved through Compostion. 

For example :
I have created a java class called Bedroom (Main Class). 
  The Bedroom class has following compositions and classes : 
                                            1) Wall 
                                            2) Bed
                                            3) Bathroom
                                            4) Lamp
